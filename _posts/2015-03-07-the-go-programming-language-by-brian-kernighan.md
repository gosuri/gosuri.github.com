title: The Go Programming Language by Brian Kernighan
---

I’m particularly excited that [Brian Kernighan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) is writing “The Go Programming Language” book.

Kernighan and Ritchie’s masterpiece [The C Programming Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language), famously known as “K&R”, is the textbook of choice for computer science graduates in universities worldwide.

His ability to simplify makes this the best C programming book ever written. Good days ahead for Go enthusiasts!

It is available to pre-order on [Amazon]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134190440). I just ordered a hard copy.
