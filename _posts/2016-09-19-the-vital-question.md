title: "Books: The Vital Question"
---

If you ever wondered why life is the way it is — why there are only two sexes and not three or 12 or how rocks, air and water coalesce into first living creatures in primordial earth — [Nick Lane’s “The Vital Question”](https://www.amazon.com/Vital-Question-Evolution-Origins-Complex/dp/0393088812) has lots of those answers

Nick is one of those origin thinkers that challenges the status-quo with his argument that we can only understand complexity of life by appreciating the role that energy plays in all living things — this book changed my understating of complex life and i think it will change yours too
