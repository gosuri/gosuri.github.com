title: Open-sourcing improves quality
---

Transparency is perhaps the biggest reason why I usually start my projects as open-source. I’ve noticed that it improves code quality on the whole.

The more I write, the more I’m convinced that there is really no good reason to keep my source code private.

[Open-sourced](https://github.com/gosuri?tab=repositories) 3 repos the past week, strongly encourage you to try it!
