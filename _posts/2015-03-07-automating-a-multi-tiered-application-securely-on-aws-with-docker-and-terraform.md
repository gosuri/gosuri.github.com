title: Automating a multi-tiered application securely on AWS with Docker and Terraform
---

I recently published my [Guide to automating a multi-tiered application securely on AWS with Docker and Terraform](https://www.airpair.com/aws/posts/ntiered-aws-docker-terraform-guide#LXCaODz2cklfBubq.01) on Airpair.
 
 While security is becoming ever more important in todayâ€™s world, it is overwhelmingly hard to decide on the right stack to build a secure infrastructure.

 I wrote this guide in an attempt to help Developers easily automate building a secure and closed network on Amazon Web Services. I gave my best to keep it simple yet comprehensive.

 Please check it out on [Airpair](https://www.airpair.com/aws/posts/ntiered-aws-docker-terraform-guide#LXCaODz2cklfBubq.01). I would greatly appreciate if you post your thoughts on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9146082) or reach out to me on [Twitter (@kn0tch)](https://twitter.com/kn0tch).
