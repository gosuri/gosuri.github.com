I am a systems programmer based in San Francisco with a deep passion for automation at scale.

I spend most of my time building [ovrclk](http://ovrclk.com). Previously, I cofounded [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com) and [Hackathon.IO](http://hackathon.io).

I activily open-source my work, mostly on [my github](https://github.com/gosuri) and at [ovrclk github page](https://github.com/ovrclk).

I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kn0tch) and [Frontback](http://frontback.me/kn0tch)
