Iâ€™m the Founder and CEO of [Overclock Labs](http://ovrclk.com), where I spend most of my time building a democratized future of the internet using protocols, tools, and infrastructure to make its foundational elements open, decentralized, and secure.

My obsessed with automation at scale began when I wrote my first line of code at 12, and I feel very fortunate to turn my hobby into a life-long career in software engineering. I also regularly [contribute](http://github.com/gosuri) to open-source software.
